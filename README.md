# Seattle Pet Licenses

## Sources
The data come from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/aaronschlegel/seattle-pet-licenses). 

> The city of Seattle makes available its database of pet licenses issued from 2005 to the beginning of 2017 as part of the city's ongoing Open Data Initiative. 

The '.csv' file is provided in this repository.

I used R to conduct my analysis.

## Code
I used the `read.csv` functions to read my data. Then, I realized several barplots. I didn't take the `NA` data into account.

## Results
I obtained the following results:
- On this graphe, we can see the number of dogs, cats and livestocks in Seattle. We can see that there are more dogs than cats and more cats than livestocks.
![Alt text](Barplot1.png?raw=true "Number of dogs, cats and livestocks")

- Here, we can see the most famous pet names:
![Alt text](Barplot2.png?raw=true "Most famous pet names")

- Here, we can see the most famous cat names:
![Alt text](Barplot3.png?raw=true "Most famous cat names")

- Here, we can see the most famous dog names:
![Alt text](Barplot13.png?raw=true "Most famous dog names")

Some famous cat and dog names may be the same but there are also specific names like "Buddy" for dogs.

- Here, we can see the most famous livestock names. We can see that these names are very different than the dogs and cats' names.

- Here, we can see the most famous dog breeds. With no surprise, Golden Retriever and Labrador are the most represented.

- Here, we can see the number of pets / ZipCode:
![Alt text](Barplot8.png?raw=true "Pets/ZipCode")
![Alt text](Barplot12.png?raw=true "Pets/ZipCode")

- Here, we can see the number of livestocks / ZipCode:
![Alt text](Barplot9.png?raw=true "Livestocks/ZipCode")

- Here, we can see the number of cats / ZipCode:
![Alt text](Barplot10.png?raw=true "Cats/ZipCode")

- Here, we can see the number of dogs / ZipCode:
![Alt text](Barplot11.png?raw=true "Dogs/ZipCode")

## To do
- Continue the analasys: why are there more pets in some ZipCode ?
- Better the barplots' design.
